# RandomLib

This is a library built for my language called Idiot Script (https://brohouse.dev/games/idiotscript/)

**How to use**<br>
Create a return variable to store the name of the return trigger<br>
Create a seed variable with any positive integer<br>
Create a max variable to any positive integer over 1<br>

It creates an variable called rnd that contains your random number<br>

**Example**<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
random_return is set to "return"<br>
seed is set to 154<br>
max is set to 10<br>
<br>
If all is set right it should print out 8<br>
