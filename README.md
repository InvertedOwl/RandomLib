# RandomLib

This is a library built for my language called Idiot Script (https://brohouse.dev/games/idiotscript/)

**How to use**
Create a return variable to store the name of the return trigger
Create a seed variable with any positive integer
Create a max variable to any positive integer over 1

It creates an variable called rnd that contains your random number

**Example**

random_return is set to "return"
seed is set to 154
max is set to 10

If all is set right it should print out 8
